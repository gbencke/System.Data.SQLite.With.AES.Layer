Each class will have its own test. For example Repository is the class, so the test will be RepositoryTests.
Naming of Tests â€“ A test should state what it is testing, and the outcome.
All constructor values that are being injected need to be tested for null. Nulls are not allowed to be passed into a contructor based on the MVS coding standards
PUnit is to be used for parallel code.
Auto properties will not be required to be tested unless a computation is involved. However, when retrieving a data object, Assert that every property holds the expected value.
